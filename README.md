# Smart_Traffic_Signalling

In present-day India, Traffic jams are a major problem especially during the peak hours of work during the weekdays in major cities. On any intersection there are moments when the density of traffic on one or more lanes is light and the other lanes have a high density. A normal traffic signaling system is incapable
of doing anything to optimize this condition, the result of this is traffic jams, fuel wastage and pollution.
To counter this problem, with the use of sensors,my project aims to come up with an idea to reduce the traffic and maintain free flow of traffic especially during the peak hours. The project has been made as economical as possible.

A ppt has been attached to highlight the main aspects of this project in a better way.
